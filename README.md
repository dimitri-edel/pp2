# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
## Preparation
I began with implementing the game logic using JavaScript. Then proceeded to designing the view elements.
 
### ISSUES
#### DESIGN
The **first design** was **not user friendly** and the mentor did not aprove. He said it was 'not nice', even thourgh I am sure he had a very different word in mind. Here is a picture of how it looked at first

So I changed it to the one you will see below.
#### MEDIA RESPONSIVE DESIGN
I have tried to cover all the devices that Chrome's dev tools had to offer. Since I am on the fast track schedule there simply was not enough time to cover them all **perfectly**. So I implemented a few generic queries that cover a range of devices. The method is simply taking the minimum required width and the minimum requred height for dimensions.
Also, there might be some left-overs of redundant CSS in the media queries I will eliminate those as soon as I get around to.

### BUGS
#### JavaScipt
There was a typo, that was causing problems. I misspelled the word lizard. There was and still is an arry by the name 'LIZARD' and a class with the name 'Lizard'. However the name of the class was spelled incorrectly like so 'Lizzard'. One of the tag id's in html alos used the incorrect spelling. I used the debugger and the culprits were found out rather quickly. I rectified the spelling in the class name and the html-tag-id and it fixed everything.
### VALIDATOR TESTING
The pages have been tested by validator.w3.org and jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator and have passed the tests.
## Deployment
The site has been deployed from GitHub Pages. The way to do that was to go to the settings. Click on the Pages icon. Select the repository and the branch. And click on Publish. And that was that.
